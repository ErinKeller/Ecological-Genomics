* Seastar wasting disease:
  * ssDNA virus
  * RNA sequence data will indicate actively transcribed genes (anything with a poly-A tail) so this is not necessarily seastar
  * intertidal collected low tide may be more stressed than subtidal samples
  * Microbiome data collected from biopsy 
  * All samples are adults
  * Al samples negative for Densovirus 
* Seastar biology
  * can be long-lived
  * Difficult to determine age
  * Dioecious (separate males and females)
  * release gametes into water
* SWD Group
  * Exclude seastars that alternated from being sick to healthy (N=2)
  * Reverse pathology
    * Know that certain genes are expressed when infected with different pathogen (Fuess 2015 PLOS1)
    * Jonathon Rast - sea urchin immunity
      * Urchins have adaptive innate immune system
      * Huge diversity in bacterial recognition pathways 
  * **Can we identify what pathogen identity causes SWD using gene expression of known immune-related genes?** What is the immune response? Is the expression of immune-related genes different between two species of starfish? Is there is a difference in immune responses between Densovirus-positive seastars and Densovirus-negative seastars?
  * Hypotheses
    * **There is a change in immune-related genes associated with particular pathogens upon infection**
    * There is a difference in immune responses between Densovirus-positive seastars and Densovirus-negative seastars
  * Experimental design
    * Analyze data at the transition from healthy to sick (time step before sick and first time step when sick)
    * For individuals that remained healthy and those always sick, pair to match time steps that match H-->S transition
    * 3 groups, 5 individuals, 2 time steps each
    * Identify particular genes associated with pathogens and a suite of randomly selected genes
* Next step:
  * As a group, write up a one page proposal using the handout as an outline
  * *Due next Monday*  email to M. Pespeni 
  * List exact sample names
* This Wednesday:
  * Library-prep types (WGA, RNA seq, GBS/radseq, amplicon seq)
  * 4 info updates'
